# Sprint Challenge: JavaScript Fundamentals

**I stumbled upon LAMBDA's curriculum and I am using her in-house student challenges to verify my self-taught knowledge of Web Programming(Javascript)**

`This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a survey of problems. This Sprint explored JavaScript Fundamentals. During this Sprint, you studied array methods, this keyword, prototypes, and class syntax. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by completing a survey of JavaScript problems.`

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

> You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Description

You will notice there are several JavaScript files being brought into the index.html file.  Each of those files contain JavaScript problems you need to solve.  If you get stuck on something, skip over it and come back to it later.

In meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) specifications listed below, you should have a console full of correct responses to the problems given.

## Self-Study Questions

Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following free-form questions.

Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read [Redacted]

1. Briefly compare and contrast `.forEach` & `.map` (2-3 sentences max)
`Both are higher order methods on arrays, .forEach returns undefined, while .map returns a value. .forEach is used to iterate over values in arrays,, while .map can iterate and manipulate return values of the array.`

2. Explain the difference between a callback and a higher order function.
`A callback is a function, passed as a parameter into a function, but waits for the original function to call it before it runs. A higher-order function is also passed into a function and returns a function when accessed by the methods of the original function.`

3. What is closure?

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
` - In Global scope, it is the window object`
` - In Prototypes, it refers to the class name`
` - In Object scope, it refers to the object before the dot`


5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
`Super is a key used to access a parent class and also call the parent methods on the extended class.`

### Task 1 - Project Set up

[Redacted]

### Task 2 - Minimum Viable Product

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

**Pro tip for this challenge: If something seems like it isn't working locally, copy and paste your code up to codepen and take another look at the console.**

#### Task A: Objects and Arrays

Test your knowledge of advanced array methods and callbacks.
* [ ] Use the [arrays-callbacks.js](challenges/arrays-callbacks.js) link to get started.  Read the instructions carefully!

#### Task B: Closure

This challenge takes a look at closures as well as scope. 
* [ ] Use the [closure.js](challenges/closure.js) link to get started. Read the instructions carefully!

#### Task C: Prototypes

Create constructors, bind methods, and create cuboids in this prototypes challenge.
* [ ] Use the [prototypes.js](challenges/prototypes.js) link to get started. Read the instructions carefully!

#### Task D: Classes

Once you have completed the prototypes challenge, it's time to convert all your hard work into classes.
* [ ] Use the [classes.js](challenges/classes.js) link to get started. Read the instructions carefully!

In your solutions, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results. Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work. It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.
